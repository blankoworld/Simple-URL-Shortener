====================

Simple Url Shortener does only one thing : minimizing url.
It is a small php script which uses sqlite. 
It's aim is to be as simple as possible.

===== Install ======

You need : 
* a HTTP server
* support for PHP 5 and SQLite

Just uncompress the tarball in a directory, the script will create 
the database and be operational directly.

== Configuration ==

There is a few vars to edit in shorturl.php.
$TITLE : name of the page
$SITE : full path to the script. If you don't want to use url
rewriting, add the name of the script and the query part, in example
http://www.0wf.fr/shorturl.php?p=
$DBFILE : name of the sqlite database file

In order to use url rewriting, with Apache 2, create a .htaccess file
with these lines :

RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^([0-9a-zA-Z]+)$ shorturl.php?p=$1 [L]

You can rename the script shorturl.php to whatever you 
want, but think about changing references to the old name in 
your configuration.
